Question 1
In Bitcoin, what model represents how transactions are consumed and created when spending value?

Question 2
The consensus mechanism that secures Bitcoin and determines which block is accepted is based on the longest chain with the greatest cumulative difficulty.

Question 
Combination of SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 hash functions  is primarily employed in the generation of Bitcoin addresses.

Question 4
By adopting the longest chain with the greatest cumulative difficulty, Bitcoin resolves conflicts when two miners broadcast different blocks.

Question 5
Mining refers to the process of adding new blocks to the blockchain through Proof-of-Work calculations.

Question 6
The 'proof of work' mechanism in Bitcoin requires miners to solve complex mathematical problems to add new blocks to the blockchain.

Question 7
To ensure transaction integrity and security, Bitcoin employs a 'cryptographic hash function' that converts input data into a fixed-size hash output.

Question 8
Bitcoin transactions are verified through 'digital signatures' that are created using a private key and can be validated by the corresponding public key.

Question 9
The 'transaction fee' in Bitcoin is the difference between total inputs and total outputs in a transaction, paid to the miner who includes it in a block.

Question 10
A 'nonce' is a random number that miners modify to help generate a valid hash for a new block in the Proof of Work process.
